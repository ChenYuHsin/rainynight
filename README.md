# Rainy Night

A chrome store app using rainyday.js to make an awesome new tab page!

## Where are the images pulled from?

### How do I submit an image?
Please create an issue! Thanks for your help.

## What's planned for the future?
A couple things:
 1. Configuration -- use your own imgur album.
 2. Forecast & local weather

## Your code sucks.
I know -- lots of messy stuff. I was frustrated with CORS and Chrome's extension API. I will clean this up ASAP.
